287. Find the Duplicate Number
Medium
Topics
Companies
Given an array of integers nums containing n + 1 integers where each integer is in the range [1, n] inclusive.

There is only one repeated number in nums, return this repeated number.

You must solve the problem without modifying the array nums and using only constant extra space.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,3,4,2,2]
Output: 2
Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,1,3,4,2]
Output: 3
Example 3:

Input: nums = [3,3,3,3,3]
Output: 3

 * @brief Plan

    Approach 1: Floydâ€™s Tortoise and Hare (Cycle Detection)
    This problem can be visualized as finding a cycle in a linked list, where the array indices represent pointers to the next element.
 
    Algorithm (Step-by-Step):
    Phase 1: Detect Intersection (Cycle)

    Since there is a cycle, the fast pointer will always find the next index quick

    Use two pointers (slow and fast).
    slow moves one step at a time.
    fast moves two steps at a time.
    If slow and fast meet, a cycle exists.
    Phase 2: Find the Start of the Cycle (Duplicate Number)

    Reset slow to the start (nums[0]) and keep fast at the intersection point.
    Move both slow and fast one step at a time.
    The point where they meet is the duplicate number.
